"We slowly walk back to the house, holding each other tightly as we take a seat inside. Lilly leans her head onto my shoulder as I put my arm around her waist."

"Neither of us has any want to break the silence."

"With her eyes shut it's hard to work out whether she's fallen asleep. Not that I mind: the warmth of her body leaning against me, the softness of her hand delicately held in mine…"

"For a long, long time we sit leaning against one another, sharing our warmth and feelings as night eventually begins to settle in."

"Lilly's gentle, soft voice ends the silence."

"She says this with surprising conviction. In the end, it was perhaps this mentality which spurred her to befriend me in such a short time, in addition to her motherly instincts."

"She did seem to become trusting very quickly, but I'd never questioned why. Now it seems obvious that she did so to help me as I went through one of the lowest points of my life."

"Despite that, I can't help savoring the soft, warm feeling enveloping my consciousness, the surge of pleasure overcoming all my senses."

"The last vestiges of it all but disappear inside her while her nails slightly scrape into my chest in an effort to stop herself from yelping in pain. A pained moan, too much for her to suppress completely, escapes from her lips."

"Neither of us had thought ourselves prepared for such a thing, of that much I'm certain."

"Entirely drained, far past the point of conversation, I look at her tired face. It looks as if the exertion, both physical and mental, has almost forced her to the verge of collapse."

hi "Hey, Lilly?"

li "Yes?"

hi "How was it? Last night, that is."

"She gives a sigh of relief, her worried expression collapsing."

"Her face afterward is the very last I'd ever wanted to see from her. It's a face I'd detested when I first saw my parents in the hospital all those months ago."

"Pity. Lilly… pities me."

"I just close my eyes and turn away, powerless. I feel like throwing up."

"I can hear the sound of Lilly moving away and quickly attending to herself, the ruffling of her clothing being pulled back on after a moment of searching just barely audible."

hi "Sorry…"

"She slowly shakes her head as she finishes buttoning up her top. Her kind smile looks so fragile, so delicate, that it makes my heart sink."

"Approaching carefully, she feels out the edge of the low table before taking a seat next to me, putting her arms around my chest."

li "I'm sorry, Hisao. I shouldn't have pushed my desires onto you."

hi "You don't need to apologize. I'd normally be fine, you've seen that much before."

hi "I guess I shouldn't have tried to push myself so far."

"My eyelids feel heavy. Calmly sitting next to her like this is probably letting the adrenaline work itself out of my system, and letting my mind relax."

"The joke seems to lighten her expression a little, a fact which helps let me feel less unease about my unreliable self."

"Lilly's head comes to rest on my shoulder as I struggle to keep my eyes open, with more difficulty after each blink. I feel completely drained."

li "It's okay, Hisao. It's all okay."

"No sooner does she say this than a small, quiet tune escapes her lips. Entirely too tired to think, all I can do is listen to her soft humming."

"It's a soft, almost melancholic tune. It sounds familiar, but the more I try to remember its origin the less I seem able to concentrate."

"The feeling and scent of her head gently resting on my shoulder and her warm body against my side are soothing. The soft humming of her voice, too, relaxes my mind as much as her warmth relaxes my muscles."

"This singular, quiet moment… after all this fracas, it makes me realize just how exhausted I've become. I can feel my eyelids slowly becoming heavier and heavier."

"Even with the chaos of before, I wish this moment would last forever."

"Lilly and I together, sharing a single, solitary occasion together, just as we used to."

"But if that's the case… why does she feel… further away than she's ever felt before?"
