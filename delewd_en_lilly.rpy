"We slowly walk back to the house, holding each other tightly as we take a seat inside. Lilly leans her head onto my shoulder as I put my arm around her waist."

"Neither of us has any want to break the silence."

"With her eyes shut it's hard to work out whether she's fallen asleep. Not that I mind: the warmth of her body leaning against me, the softness of her hand delicately held in mine…"

"For a long, long time we sit leaning against one another, sharing our warmth and feelings as night eventually begins to settle in."

"Lilly's gentle, soft voice ends the silence."

"She did seem to become trusting very quickly, but I'd never questioned why. Now it seems obvious that she did so to help me as I went through one of the lowest points of my life."

"This girl in front of me, reserved yet playful, astute yet hospitable, is the girl I've fallen in love with."

"I lean forward, delicately taking her shoulders in my hands."

"As I do, she brings her hands to my chest. With a slightly uneven breath, we lean into a deep kiss."

"I feel one of Lilly's hands slowly slide up to my shoulder, it and her head very gently moving forwards. Assuming her intent, I lean back onto the floor."

"She lowers herself beside me, one hand stroking my hair as the other moves across my chest."

"This must be her way of taking in what I've already seen of her; despite her lack of sight, she engraves every detail of my bare body and chest into her mind."

"When her middle finger falls into the slight recess of my chest scar, a lingering effect of my operation so many months ago, she slowly runs her hand down its length."

li "This is…"

hi "The scar, from my surgery. They had to do this in order to operate on my heart."

"For a moment she's lost for words, the idea of such extensive scarring adding a new worry for her. Her expression changes from curiosity to apprehension."

li "Should we… really be doing this kind of thing…?"

"Those words bother me beyond what is rational. Lilly's face breaks my heart more than even her words possibly could, yet I don't even know the answer to her question."

"I can't let this condition dominate me forever. It may not even be medically advisable, but I outright refuse to live my life in such a prison."

hi "It's okay, Lilly. This much will be okay."

"Long minutes pass in almost total silence, our heavy breathing the only sound to be heard in the house."

li "Hisao…"

"I wait a second for the rest of the sentence, but none is forthcoming."

"I can't help smiling as I stroke her hair from her face a couple of times, reassuring her."

hi "I love you, Lilly."

"She nods weakly, rubbing my hair with her left hand. If we could simply remain together like this for an eternity, it would be a paradise like no other."

n "Hanako, Lilly and I wandered about outside, exploring the extent of the surprisingly large tract of land surrounding the house. Then we spent the majority of the afternoon resting, watching television, reading, and playing cards."

n "It may not have been the most exciting finale to the trip, but such tranquil peacefulness is something to savor. Even after we return to the school tomorrow, I think I'll remember this little house in Hokkaido for a long time."

n "It's a pity we only have a couple more hours to spend here before going to get the train back."

n "All I can do is yawn contentedly while I watch the steam slowly rising from the clear water's placid surface, my eyes eventually locking onto the ceiling."

n "Our exams are imminent. I've barely studied at all for them."

"As I busily attempt to rationalize all that's happened, I hear a series of raps on the door. I pick myself up and sit upright, trying to figure out the source."

li "Maybe this was a bit too…"

hi "Don't worry, it's okay."

"The situation only becomes even more awkward. As if to distract herself, Lilly runs her free hand over her legs while holding one over her breasts for modesty."

"I sit idly watching the wall ahead of me and the rising steam, every now and again stealing a glimpse at her body."

hi "You know, compared to Akira, you look a lot more foreign."

li "I took after my mother's side, genetically. Akira took after my father's more."

hi "I guess that makes sense. How on Earth did a native Scot and a Japanese businessman meet, anyway?"

li "My mother was a journalist. She met my father while he was at a conference in Inverness."

hi "Ah, I see. Taking after your Scottish side would also explain your height, I suppose."

"I look back down at her as she nods, and sigh at the ridiculousness of the situation."

hi "This really is too much, isn't it?"

li "You're enjoying it though, aren't you?"

hi "In some ways, yes. I guess things turned out okay, in the end."

hi "Everything's settled down, Hanako took our relationship well, and we'll be going back to school tomorrow."

li "Indeed. It's a shame to be going back so soon, but we'll still have our memories of this place."

hi "Memories, huh? I suppose so. We'll have to see how everything goes once we get back, but for now… I'm just glad you like me."

hi "I've been winding myself up for weeks about that, so I'm thankful for things turning out like this."

li "Hisao, please…"

"Even as she says it, her mouth curls upward into a smile, her tone caught between embarrassment and awkward giggling."

"She shakily stands and offers her hands for me to lead her out of the cramped bathtub."

"She maneuvers herself out of the bath as I do, our hands holding each other's."

"Eventually I sit beside the bathtub, the two of us fussing around a little until we get comfortable."

"She bows her head down to give me a small kiss, my hand reaching up to hold strands of her disheveled hair as we once again sit in blissful silence."

"I move onwards, finding myself thankful that Lilly's room is so neat and tidy. Even the piles of books she has are generally kept close to the wall, well out of harm's way."

"The hard wall pressing against my outstretched hands makes me furrow my brow in frustration."

hi "Hey Lilly, where are you?"

li "What are you doing over there? I'm over here."

"Lilly's voice comes from the other side of the room, far from where it was before, even to my untrained ears. If she's going out of her way to avoid me reaching her, then is this just a game to her?"

"…Of course it is. Compared to a life where even the concept of sight is an abstract one, a few minutes in a blindfold are nothing."

"I guess she's made her point; she's more than capable of navigating her room, and further, I've seen how independent she is even when compared to many of the others in Yamaku."

"Well, even if this is just a game, I may as well play it wholeheartedly."

"With a pace much quicker than before I move towards the source of her voice, deftly sidestepping the table in the center of her room thanks to remembering its position."

hi "I've got you now!"

"She gives an impish giggle, one just long enough to work out that she's passing just beside me."

"With a measure of unease tempered by curiosity, I do as she says and lower the blindfold over my eyes. The world becomes dark once again."

"I reflexively tense as I feel Lilly's hand gently brush the side of my face, entirely unable to anticipate her touch."

"I really need to get more used to contact like this. Even after the weeks we've been going out, it isn't as natural for me as it is for her."

"…Silence?"

hi "Hey, Lilly…"

li "Shh."

"I obediently follow her instruction and quietly listen, trying to make out something, anything, that's happening around me."

"Compared to before when I was chasing Lilly, the need to carefully navigate the room's obstacles now gone, I can take my time and concentrate much harder on listening."

"It takes a while, but I can eventually pick out the soft sound of her breathing in the otherwise dead silent room."

"In… out… in… out…"

"Measuring it against my own breathing, I realize it's definitely deeper than normal, especially for her."

"If she's like this, then that means she has to be sitting against her bed and facing me. Now, to continue."

"…All right, this must be her hip. If I just move slowly downwards…"

"Just as I'd worked out, Lilly sits in front of me."

"Once again I reach out and brush her hair from her face, her chin tilting outwards."

hi "Lilly…"

"When she reaches out to brush my face, my urges take complete control of my body. Without so much as a second thought, I push myself over her frame."

"It's an unusual feeling, being like this. I feel oddly powerful. As though, for the first time since the accident so long ago, I feel physically strong."

hi "Lilly… I want you."

li "Ah, Hisao!? What are you—?"

"I slide my hands underneath her, soft silk and skin pressing into my hands as I gently raise her body, with a measure of difficulty."

"While I wouldn't describe her as heavy… her height makes her more than a handful to try and lift."

"It only takes a couple of carefully placed steps to feel the edge of her bed against my legs, my lowering of Lilly onto her sheets just as gentle as when I raised her."

hi "Your bed will be more comfortable than the floor, right?"

li "Always the gentleman, aren't you?"

"I quickly run my hands down Lilly's long, shapely legs, their allure far from diminished without the luxury of sight."

"With one hand on her bed to steady myself, my right moves tentatively downwards."

"Uh, whoops. My first contact with her is my palm clumsily meeting the front of her nose."

"She giggles a little before turning her head sideways. Taking my cue, I gently cradle her cheek and use my thumb to feel the contours of her face as she so often does with me."

"This would be a lot easier if she wasn't moving her face into my hand, but the feeling of her nuzzling into it is nice."

"I feel Lilly's eyes clenching shut, the movement of her cheek under my thumb reminding me of the gentle hold I have on the side of her face."

"From her cheek to her neck, I begin to slide my hand downwards to take in the feeling of her body."

"The contours of her collarbone… the light dew resting on her skin…"

"My sense of smell is stimulated by the scent of her sweat and mine hanging in the air. Even the ambient smell, noticeably different from that of my own room, adds to the feeling."

"I can feel her hands clasp my wrists, their grip surprisingly tight."
