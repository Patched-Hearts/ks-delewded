"Finally reaching the classroom after the usual walk from the dormitories, I step inside. My eyes immediately turn to the third seat from the left in the back row; Hanako's seat."

"It's empty, and after glancing around the classroom, it looks like she isn't here yet. The two girls from the newspaper club are here in the two seats to the left of Hanako's, as are Shizune and Misha, but that's about it."

"We exchange morning greetings before I take my seat. I have to admit that this is a bit of a relief. This gives me at least a few more minutes to think."

"Not that I haven't been doing so previously; ever since our trip to town, Hanako's been on my mind."

"I still don't know what to make of my relationship to Hanako. I like her, I can admit that much to myself. I want to protect and shield her from the pain she feels. I really don't think my feelings are just those of friendship any more."

"But that said… I feel like I don't even know her."

"If I made a move on her, how would she take it? Is she in an emotional state that allows her to make a reasonable decision about a relationship? How would she cope with anything that might happen afterwards?"

"My eyes are immediately drawn to the scarring on her back. The skin on her right side is of a similar texture to that of her face, but it's also stretched taut and covering a much larger area. The scarring is by far the worst on the shoulder, buttock, and thigh."

"Just as my heart attack redefined my life… this is the event that redefined Hanako's."

"If I'd seen this when I first met her, I'd have been shocked. Not only at the sight, but also at the idea that something like this was survivable."

"But after having had time to get used to the idea, and after seeing the scars on her face, hands and collar, my reaction is more measured. My reaction right now is not due to her scarring, but to her body."

"There's no point in denying the obvious. I think what I should say now, and what Hanako wants me to say now, is the truth. What I genuinely, honestly, believe."

hi "It doesn't matter. You're a wonderful person, Hanako. Your body doesn't change that."

"She looks at me for a long time, her breathing uneven as she tries to remain steady amidst the emotions we're both feeling. It feels less like she's looking at me than she's looking through me."

"I slowly walk towards her, and gently place my hands on her shoulders as she lets go of her blouse. She gasps a little; not in fright, but in simple startlement."

"Being so close to her causes my mind to become a jumble of feelings. The scarring on her shoulder, plain to see and leather-like to the touch, conflicts strangely with her otherwise soft skin and silky dark hair."

"Hanako is a girl, with all that entails. She's taller than usual for a woman, but still has curves in all the right places. The nape of her neck, just visible thanks to her hair slung over her shoulder, is alluring."

"I guess she's made her point; she's more than capable of navigating her room, and further, I've seen how independent she is even when compared to many of the others in Yamaku."

"This would be a lot easier if she wasn't moving her face into my hand, but the feeling of her nuzzling into it is nice."

"I swallow to try and steady myself, take my other hand from the bed and use it to guide myself into her."

"As soon as I feel her warmth around me, I quickly realize just how turned on I am."

"With my sight gone I'm free to concentrate far more on my other senses, including tactile feeling. The entire experience feels more vivid, more intense than it's been before."

"I feel Lilly's eyes clenching shut, the movement of her cheek under my thumb reminding me of the gentle hold I have on the side of her face."

"It's hard to stop myself from being completely overwhelmed. It's hard to think that this is what sex is usually like for her, experienced through every sense but the one I hold dearest."

"From her cheek to her neck, I begin to slide my hand downwards to take in the feeling of her body."

"The contours of her collarbone… the light dew resting on her skin…"

"My sense of smell is stimulated by the scent of her sweat and mine hanging in the air. Even the ambient smell, noticeably different from that of my own room, adds to the feeling."

"When I move my hand to her supple breast, her soft mewling fills my ears, along with the sound of our act."

"The skin under my hand moves back and forth with each thrust, my grip on it tightening as my lust for the near-naked body of Lilly before me grows."

"I can even feel her small nipple against my palm. My hand slides further and my fingers pluck it through the thin silk of her pajama top."

"Her whimpering sounds turn to moans as she fills with the same pleasure as I. I can feel my heart beating loudly in my chest, and her own beating underneath my hand."

"I can feel her hands clasp my wrists, their grip surprisingly tight as her chest rises in overwhelming pleasure."
